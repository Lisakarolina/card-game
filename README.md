# Card Game

This card game shows a panel with a collection of 30 different images of bridges.
The instructions are the following: Klick on an image that you haven't clicked on before. If you're right and this image has not been touched you are rewarded a point. The images are then rearranged. If, however, the image has already been clicked on in this game your score is reset and a new game starts. You can achieve a maximum of 30 points.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The images are royalty-free pictures taken from pexels.com.
